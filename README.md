<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

## Introduction

A programming algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions in which these actions describe how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time. There are several different types of programming alogrithms:

<!-- Algorithms -->

## Algorithms in C programming language

<br>

### 1. Bubble Sort

Compile the source code file `bubble-sort.c` in your terminal

```sh
gcc bubble-sort.c
```

<!-- Note that to make a file executable -->

GCC compiler gives the output file as a.out file by default, then execute the given file as below:

```sh
./a.out
```

Source code: [program](https://github.com/Ikko-T/alogorithms/blob/main/bubble-sort.c)

<br>

### 2. Insertion Sort

Compile the source code file `insertionSort.c` in your terminal

```sh
gcc insertionSort.c
```

<!-- Note that to make a file executable -->

GCC compiler gives the output file as a.out file by default, then execute the given file as below:

```sh
./a.out
```

Source code: [program](https://github.com/Ikko-T/alogorithms/blob/main/insertionSort.c)

<br>

### 3. Linear Search

Compile the source code file `linearSearch.c` in your terminal

```sh
gcc linearSearch.c
```

<!-- Note that to make a file executable -->

GCC compiler gives the output file as a.out file by default, then execute the given file as below:

```sh
./a.out
```

### 4. Find Min. Max. Ave.

Compile the source code file `findMinMaxAve.c` in your terminal

```sh
gcc findMinMaxAve.c
```

<!-- Note that to make a file executable -->

GCC compiler gives the output file as a.out file by default, then execute the given file as below:

```sh
./a.out
```

Source code: [program](https://github.com/Ikko-T/alogorithms/blob/main/findMinMaxAve.c)
